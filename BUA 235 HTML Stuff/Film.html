<h1><center> My Filming History </h1></center>

<center><img src="shs.jpg" style="width:413;height:301;"></center>
<h2><center> I worked for the Swampscott High School Cable Channel and was a member of the Swampscott High School Cable Club. We did many productions, including but not limited to, in class film assignments, filming the town meetings, filming the school committee meetings, and filming things for clients. </center></h2>

<h3><center> I spent a lot of my time producing my own films, producing and running the School Committee meetings, and running our town meeting productions. I also would film the band and chorus concerts occasionally, but I was mostly doing the more important productions.</center></h3>

<h4><center> One of my films I'm most proud of is my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vp7GSo1Pyig"> final </a> which was an interview of the band director at Swampscott High School.</center></h4>
