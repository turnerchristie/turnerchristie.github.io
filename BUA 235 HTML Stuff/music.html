<h1><center> One thing most people find out about me later is my love for music! It's always been a big part of my life, but most recently it has become so much more meaningfull to me.</center></h1>

<h2><center> My favorite instrument to play is the guitar! I have a Breedlove Discovery Series guitar! </center></h2>

<h3><center> Some bands I listen to that you might know of are <a href="https://summersaltband.bandcamp.com/"> Summer Salt </a> and <a href="http://www.yourwalters.com/"> The Walters</a>

<h4><center> Music has and will always carry me through my toughest time in life. I can get through anything as long as at the end of the day I can listen to a song, play my guitar, or sing a song to myself. It's the reason me and Becky are as close as we are and it has brought me and my mom closer than ever.</center></h4>
