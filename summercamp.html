<h1><center><u> My Summer Camp Experience </u></center></h1>
<h2><center> Camp Joslin is a home away from home for me. I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes at the age of 16, and even though it was a change for me, it wasn't the biggest one. My identical twin Damon has had Type 1 Diabetes for 10 years, and he has been apart of the Camp Joslin Family since his diagnosis. I was scared to go to camp, but with a push from my mom I fell in love with it. Camp Joslin is how I prefer to spend my summers, and I will always love it. </center></h2>
